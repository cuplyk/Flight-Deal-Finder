#Flight Tracker

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Description
The Flight Tracker is a python project that tracks the cheapest flights available for different locations. The program takes data from a Google sheet that contains various locations and their lowest prices that we want to visit. Then, it feeds this data into a flight search API, which searches for the cheapest flights available in the next six months. When the program finds a flight that's lower than our predefined price, it sends the date and price via our Twilio SMS module to our mobile phone so that we can book it right there and then.
